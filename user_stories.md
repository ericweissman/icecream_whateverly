 As a user,
  - I should be able to launch the app from welcome screen
  - I should be able to see all flavors of ice cream from the main screen
  -Each ice cream flavor card should include a picture, title (name of flavor), description and a button that shows where the ice cream is available
  - When I click on the button prompting info on where ice cream is available, I will be shown a list of cards of all of  the parlors that have the flavor of ice cream I clicked on  
  - The parlors listed will clearly display the address, phone number, rating, hours and price range
  - I will be able to move backwards in the flow by clicking on a navigation button
  - I will be able to utilize a search bar to search for ice cream flavors by keyword
