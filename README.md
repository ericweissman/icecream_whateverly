## Background/About
#### iScream was the first project our contributors built using React. After creating a large dataset on ice cream flavors and parlors, we utilized the Fetch API call to import data that we would use for the app. The app allows users to easily see all of the ice cream flavors available throughout Denver. Once a user clicks on a flavor, they can see all the parlors (along with their address) where the ice cream is available. If a user clicks on an individual parlor, they are shown a more detailed page that includes all relevant information for the given parlor. By utilizing small components for the ice cream cards, parlors, and parlor details, our users can easily and intuitively navigate between flavors and parlors! 

## Primary Technologies Used
- React
- SCSS
- Jest
- Enzyme

## Next Steps
#### Future iterations of the project could include:
- Search functionality for parlors
- Only show parlors/flavors that are available based on user's local time
- Ability for users to favorite flavors and/or parlors
